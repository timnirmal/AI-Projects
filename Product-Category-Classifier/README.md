# Product Category Classifier

We aim to create a product category API that utilizes machine learning and deep learning to predict the possible categories/classes for any provided product name and its descriptions. The problem is considered for an e-commerce domain and the dataset used to train our models will contain some products and their labeled categories.

## Multi-Class vs Multi-Label

Multi-Label Classification is a problem where the model is trained to predict multiple labels for a single input. 

Multi-Class Classification is a problem where the model is trained to predict a single label for a single input.

To solve multi-label problems, we mainly have approaches:

Binary classification: This strategy divides the problem into several independent binary classification tasks. It resembles the one-vs-rest method, but each classifier deals with a single label, which means the algorithm assumes they are mutually exclusive.

Multi-class classification: The labels are combined into one big binary classifier called powerset. For instance, having the targets A, B, and C, with 0 or 1 as outputs, we have A B C -> [0 1 0], while the binary classification transformation treats it as A B C -> [0] [1] [0].

Binary Classification

We will first use the Binary classification technique, which has been also explained above. In the below, you can see how we are creating a separate classifier for a separate product category, in machine learning this technique is called one-vs-all. We have used a simple linear regression model as a single product classification model. Other models worth trying are Naive Bayes, SVC, Random Forest.
